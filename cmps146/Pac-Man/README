Pac-Man project for Game AI. Given the java source code for Pac-Man, create
an AI for Pac-Man and an AI for the ghosts. The goal for Pac-Man was to 
maximize points, and the goal for the ghosts was to minimize points. The 
options of Finite State Machine, Hierarchical Finite State Machine, and 
Behavior Trees were given to build the AI. For both Pac-Man and the ghosts,
we opted to use Behavior Trees.
